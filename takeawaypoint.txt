Middleware

one request must have one response 
Function which has request, response, next are called Middleware
next() is used to trigger another Middleware

Two types of middleware based on error
Normal middleware = (req,res,next) =>{} to trigger another middleware next()
error middleware = (err,req,res,next) =>{} to trigger another middleware next(err)

Two types of middleware based on location 
Route middleware => defined in route 
Application middlware => defined in index.js (or main file)
